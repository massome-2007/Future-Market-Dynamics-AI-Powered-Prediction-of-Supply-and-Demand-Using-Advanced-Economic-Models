# Future Market Dynamics: AI-Powered Prediction of Supply and Demand Using Advanced Economic Models
Project Overview:
This project uses machine learning to predict future market dynamics by incorporating advanced supply and demand concepts such as elasticity, equilibrium, and the Phillips Curve. Key features include price elasticity of demand, price elasticity of supply, market equilibrium, and the influence of inflation and unemployment on supply and demand.

Explanation:
Synthetic Data Generation: Created synthetic data to simulate demand and supply curves, inflation rates, and unemployment rates.

Feature Selection: Included price, inflation rate, and unemployment rate as features to predict demand and supply.

Model Training: Used linear regression models to predict future demand and supply quantities based on the given features.

Equilibrium Prediction: Predicted future quantities and identified the equilibrium price and quantity where demand equals supply.

Visualization: Plotted the actual vs predicted supply and demand curves and highlighted the equilibrium price and quantity.

Key Features:
Synthetic Data: Simulated realistic data for price, inflation rates, and unemployment rates to model future market conditions.

Linear Regression: Simple yet effective machine learning models to predict demand and supply.

Advanced Economic Concepts: Incorporated concepts like price elasticity, market equilibrium, and the impact of macroeconomic indicators (inflation and unemployment) on supply and demand.

Equilibrium Prediction: Identified the market equilibrium point using the predicted demand and supply curves.

Visualization: Provided clear visual representation of the results to make the predictions easily interpretable.
